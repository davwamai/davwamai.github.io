                        Many students struggle on a semesterly basis to sucessfully locate
                        thier classes resulting in tardiness and a content absorption disadvantage.
                        Not only is locating the building in which the class is in a challenge,
                        but finding the classroom itself is often a problem disregarded.

                        After careful consideration of what our application might need in regards to features, 
                        we derived several methods of conveinience from existing apps with the intention of integrating them
                        all in one place.
